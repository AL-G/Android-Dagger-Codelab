<h3>Project Structure (before adding splash screen)</h3>

<p>The app consists of 4 different flows (implemented as Activities):</p>
<p>Registration: The user can register by introducing username, password and accepting our terms and conditions.
  </br>Login: The user can log in using the credentials introduced during the registration flow and can also unregister from the app.
  </br>Home: The user is welcomed and can see how many unread notifications they have.
  </br>Settings: The user can log out and refresh the number of unread notifications (which produces a random number of notifications).

The project follows a typical MVVM pattern where all the complexity of the View is deferred to a ViewModel</p>
